			<h3>About us</h3>
			<p>Our purpose at Organic Steps is to improve students' experience of the organic chemistry sequence. We strive to achieve this goal by focusing on 5 elements; a term we coined,<b>
				FRICH</b></p><br>
					<li><b>F</b>oundational ideas of the curriculum<br></li>
					<li><b>R</b>relevant practice problems<br></li>
					<li><b>I</b>mportant questions<br></li>
					<li><b>C</b>ommunity mindset<br></li>
					<li><b>H</b>igh yield study strategies<br></li>
			<p>With the right approach to understanding and practicing organic chemistry material, students will thrive in their courses. Our regular session leaders know what it is like to be in your place. Our plan is to share the strategies that helped us find success while building a community of students passionate about the subject. We are passionate about teaching, participate in research, and have course experience beyond organic chemistry. 
				We would be honored to join you in your academic endeavors.

			<h3>Our Tip for OCHEM</h3>
			<p>Our philosophy behind academic success is that comprehension is greater than memorization. Instead of force feeding our brains information about chemical reactions and memorizing spectroscopy values, let’s focus on the foundational ideas behind such concepts. Not only will understanding these concepts make memorization easier, but this comprehension will lead to greater enjoyment of the subject.</p>
